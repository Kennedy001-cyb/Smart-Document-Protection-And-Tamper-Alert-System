# Smart Document Protection and Tamper Alert System

This project implements a robust system to protect critical documents from unauthorized modifications and alert you instantly to any detected tampering. Leveraging Python's `watchdog` library for real-time file monitoring and a custom AI-driven anomaly detection model, it provides a crucial layer of security for sensitive information. The system also integrates with UltraMsg to send instant WhatsApp notifications for critical events, ensuring you're always informed, even when the monitoring script runs silently in the background.

## üåü Features

* **Real-time File Monitoring:** Continuously watches specified documents for any changes (modifications, creations).
* **Hash-based Tamper Detection:** Generates and compares SHA-256 hashes of document content to detect unauthorized alterations.
* **Content Difference Reporting:** Pinpoints the exact lines that have been added, deleted, or modified in a tampered document.
* **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** An integrated AI model assesses the **risk score** of detected changes based on factors like:
    * **Number of changes:** More changes generally lead to a higher risk.
    * **Time of modification:** Modifications outside of regular working hours (e.g., 6 AM - 10 PM WAT) increase the risk.
    * **Location of the file:** Files found outside the designated "safe copy" folder pose a higher risk.
    * **Sensitive Keywords:** The presence of predefined sensitive keywords (e.g., 'bank', 'confidential', 'legal') in changed lines contributes to the risk score.
    * **The AI Risk Score (0-100%)** helps differentiate between minor, legitimate changes and potentially malicious tampering, providing a clear indication of the severity. A score of 60% or higher is flagged as "highly unusual tampering."
* **WhatsApp Alerts:** Sends immediate notifications to a designated WhatsApp number via UltraMsg when tampering is detected or a document is restored.
* **Detailed Event Logging:** Maintains a JSON log of all detected events, including timestamps, file paths, and specific content changes.
* **Silent Background Operation:** Can be launched invisibly using a VBScript, allowing the monitoring to run discreetly without a command prompt window.
* **Automatic Restoration Detection:** Identifies when a tampered document has been restored to its original, pristine state, reducing the risk score to 0%.

    ```

### Step 2: Install Python and Libraries

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**
    * Press the `Windows` key, type `cmd`.
    * Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as Administrator."
2.  **Install Python Libraries:** Type the following commands one by one and press Enter:
    ```bash
    pip install watchdog
    pip install python-docx
    pip install requests
    ```
    These libraries are essential for file monitoring, reading Word documents, and sending WhatsApp notifications.

### Step 3: Write Hashing Code (`save_hash.py`)

This script creates a "digital fingerprint" (hash) of your original document. If the document is ever changed, this fingerprint will no longer match, indicating tampering.

1.  **Open Notepad.**
2.  **Paste the following Python code:**

    ```python
    import hashlib
    import os

    def generate_hash(file_path):
        with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
            content = f.read()
        return hashlib.sha256(content).hexdigest()

    # IMPORTANT: Update this path to your document's actual location
    file_path = r"C:\Users\USER\Desktop\ProtectedDocs\List_of_Freshly_Employed_Personnel_and_Their_Roles.docx"

    # Ensure the directory for hash.txt exists before trying to write to it
    hash_file_dir = os.path.dirname(file_path)
    if not os.path.exists(hash_file_dir):
        os.makedirs(hash_file_dir)

    original_hash = generate_hash(file_path)

    # Save the hash in a .txt file, not .docx
    with open(os.path.join(hash_file_dir, "hash.txt"), "w") as h:
        h.write(original_hash)

    print("Original file hash saved.")
    ```

3.  **Save** this file as `save_hash.py` inside your `ProtectedDocs` folder.
4.  **Run it from a normal Command Prompt** (not as Admin):
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\USER\Desktop\ProtectedDocs
    python save_hash.py
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `C:\Users\USER\` with your actual user path.)*

    This will create a `hash.txt` file in your `ProtectedDocs` folder, storing the original document's fingerprint.

### Step 4: Monitor File for Changes (`watcher.py`)

This is the core script that continuously monitors your document and triggers alerts.

1.  **Open Notepad.**
2.  **Paste the following Python code:**

    ```python
    import time
    import hashlib
    import datetime
    import os
    import json
    import requests
    import re
    from watchdog.observers import Observer

## üöÄ How to Run and Simulate Tampering

### 1. Start the Monitoring Script

Navigate to your `ProtectedDocs` folder in Command Prompt:

```bash
cd C:\Users\USER\Desktop\ProtectedDocs
Then, run the watcher script:

Bash

python watcher.py
(Remember to replace C:\Users\USER\ with your actual user path.)

You will see "[SECURITY] Monitoring started..." in your terminal.

2. Simulate Tampering
While watcher.py is running:

Open List_of_Freshly_Employed_Personnel_and_Their_Roles.docx.
Make a change, for example, change "Chris Okoro" to "Iloduba Johnkennedy".
Save and close the document.
3. Observe the Output
Terminal Output: Your command prompt will immediately show "Tampering detected!"
WhatsApp Alert: You will receive a WhatsApp message on the number configured in watcher.py detailing the detected changes and the AI risk score.
Log File: A tamper_log.json file will be created/updated in your ProtectedDocs folder, containing a detailed record of the event.
üëª Hiding the Script (Silent Operation)
To keep the watcher.py script running invisibly in the background, you can use a VBScript launcher.

Steps to Use VBScript Launcher
Open Notepad.

Paste this VBScript:

VB.Net

Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WshShell.Run "cmd /c python C:\Users\USER\Desktop\ProtectedDocs\watcher.py", 0
Set WshShell = Nothing
(IMPORTANT: Update the Python script path C:\Users\USER\Desktop\ProtectedDocs\watcher.py to your exact file location.)

Save this file as RunWatcher.vbs inside your ProtectedDocs folder.

Double-click RunWatcher.vbs. The Python watcher will start invisibly without opening a command prompt window.

This method works assuming Python is installed and properly added to your system's PATH environment variable.

How to Stop the VBScript-Launched Watcher
Since the VBScript runs the Python process invisibly, you'll need to stop it manually:

Open Task Manager (Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc).
Go to the "Details" tab (or "Processes" tab on older Windows versions).
Look for Python.exe in the list.
Select it, right-click, and choose "End task".
This action will fully stop the invisible monitoring script.

üìà AI Risk Score Explained
The AI Risk Score is a crucial component of this system, providing a quantitative measure of the potential threat posed by a detected change. The score is calculated on a scale of 0% to 100%, with higher percentages indicating greater suspicion.

Low Risk (0-59%): Typically indicates minor changes, or authorized copies that have been restored to their original state. An "Unauthorized Copy Detected (Content Restored)" event will have a 0% risk, even if the file is outside the safe folder, because its content is no longer tampered.
High Risk (60-100%): Signals potentially unusual or malicious tampering. These events trigger a "‚ö† AI WARNING: Highly unusual tampering detected!" message in the console and WhatsApp.
The AI considers:

Volume of Changes: Numerous alterations instantly raise the score.
Time of Day: Modifications during unusual hours (late night, early morning) increase suspicion.
File Location: Changes to files outside designated "safe" locations are viewed with higher risk.
Sensitive Content: If the changes involve keywords related to financial, legal, or confidential information, the risk escalates significantly.
This intelligent scoring helps prioritize alerts, allowing you to focus on the most critical security incidents.

üéØ Example Results
Here are examples of how the system responds to different scenarios:

Scenario 1: Tampering Detected
When "Chris Okoro" was changed to "Iloduba Johnkennedy":

üö® Tamper Detected üö®
